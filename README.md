# Dotfiles

This repo holds my dotfiles. They are specific to my needs but you might find something useful here if you are a zsh/vim/tmux user.

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/RWalecki/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
sudo apt-get install zsh
exec zsh
```

NOTE: This installation moves your current dotfiles to $HOME/.dotfiles_backup.
