# Dotfiles

This repo holds my dotfiles. They are specific to my needs but if you are a Python, Vim or UNIX hacker you might find something useful here.

## Installation

    bash install.sh

This moves your current dotfiles to $HOME/.dotfiles_backup and symlinks the dotfiles folders and files into your home folder.
